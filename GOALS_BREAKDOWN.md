## Scientific Formulas Used:

### BMI (Body Mass Index):
```
BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²)
```

### BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) - Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
```
Men: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age(years) + 5
Women: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age(years) - 161
```

### TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure):
```
TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier
- Sedentary: BMR × 1.2
- Light Activity: BMR × 1.375
- Moderate Activity: BMR × 1.55
- Very Active: BMR × 1.725
- Extra Active: BMR × 1.9
```

### Water Intake:
```
Daily Water = 35ml × bodyweight(kg)
Example: 70kg person = 2,450ml (2.45L) per day
```
